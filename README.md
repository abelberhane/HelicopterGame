# HelicopterGame

C# Windows Form Game developed in Visual Studio. I will work on this game in my spare time and hope to use this game for some practice 
with new functionality I am not familiar with. This game is not a high priority but I will work on it occasionally. 

**1/26/18** - Fixed a bug in the Message Box

Enhancements Planned: 
1) Restart Button
2) Change wallpaper and Text
3) Start Menu?
